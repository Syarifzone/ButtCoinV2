This is the place where the SNAYL white-paper will be located, as well as the source-code.
# UNDER CONSTRUCTION !


## Why the name SNAYL ?
First, we wanted to use the word "Snail" but it was overused just like the word "Butt" as in ButtCoin. We had to have something more unique. Second, it represents the speed at which transfers will happen on the network.

## Why the second project under the ButtCoin ?
We are bringing something new and less strict and rigid than a ButtCoin. We want people to be able to do everything with this token that they want to do with 0xBUTT, but can't due to 0xBUTT rules. For example, we want to list it on as many exchanges as possible, do the airdrops, and have all the fun we simply can't have with a ButtCoin. Also, we want to make people aware of the 0xBUTT (ButtCoin) project.

## Why is it so slow and how long does it take to process a transfer ?
The reason is because we want to create a deflationary token that has the following features:
- Token is deflationary
- Token is immune to market manipulations
- Token is not self-destructive (no burning)

There is no time involved in a transfer process. Instead, there is a 0.2% chance that your transfer will be processed each time someone else makes a transfer. Eventually, your transfer will process, but it could take time... This way, we are preventing the market manipulations since the market manipulators won't be able to controll their transfers as well as the market.

## How is this token deflationary ?
As mentioned, there is no burning involved. By definition, if we can lower the market concentration (the focus on a market trade and possible price manipulation) and focus on the competition, then we have a deflationary token.

## How do you focus on the competition more than on a market price manipulation ?
By making the token transfers impossible to predict, we are preventing the market concentration. Furthermore, by making the token more scarce and by buffering the transfers, we are increasing a demand as well as a competition.

## How do you plan to make the token more scarce ?
Simply because you are always processing someone else's transfer, you can take 1% from their transfer. Unfortunately, zero transfers are NOT allowed, but you may get no reward tokens if they transfer less than 100.

## Why the low supply and no decimals ?
We want to see the prices rise as well as a demand. Introducing decimals makes no sense for this project.
