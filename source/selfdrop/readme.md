# The 0xBUTT Self-Drop faucet and a passive income and a Farthings v2.0 Token

## How does it work ?
Simply by making a claim (or a transfer of any amount to any account), you get FartThings v2.0 tokens. Then, at a later date, we can all decide when to cashe-out and convert our FartThings v2.0 to 0xBUTT v2.0 coins at a 1:1 ratio.

## Why a separate token ?
Unless you are interested in providing your private key or wasting ETH gas on the approvals and transactions, there is really no simpler option to help us get as many addresses as possible! Also, the transfer of tokens costs much less since we are not burning anything.

## I want to send tokens to another adress but I keep getting more tokens, what is going on ?
This is because the transfer function has been altered. You CANNOT send these tokens. However, you can destroy them

## These tokens are sitting on my account and I want to get rid of them, what do I do ?
You will have to go to Etherscan, and execute the Delete function. It will burn all of your FartTings tokens!

## So how does this work and how do I get the passive income at all ?

1. The self-drop is meant to reward anyone who makes a claim as well as any random address with the same claim. Random address is any (previous) address that made a claim. The rewards are distributed in a following manner:

2. Each time you make a claim, you are guaranteed to get 100 tokens!

- If you make a claim for the first time with your address, you get only 100 tokens, and you have to make the second claim.

- If the random address was given more tokens than you, we apply this formula and add it to your reward of 100 tokens: 
(60% of random address rewards) - (60% of your rewards)

- If you have more tokens than a random address, we add 50 tokens to your reward of 100 tokens.

- If you have more tokens than a random address, we apply the same formula and reward the random address with it.
(60% of your rewards) - (60% of random address rewards)


This is how we will get a good distribution of tokens, and it is also how you may earn the tokens even if you don't make any claims!  Nevertheless, if there aren't enough people making the claims, you will not be earning anything unless making the claims yourself.
