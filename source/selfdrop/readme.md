This is a quick document about the ButtCoin self-drop (faucet).

The self-drop is meant to reward anyone who makes a claim and any random address in a following manner:

Each time you make a claim, you are guaranteed to get 100 tokens!

- If you make a claim for the first time with your address, you get only 100 tokens.

- If the random address has more tokens than you, we apply this formula and add it to your reward of 100 tokens: 
(60% of random_address_claims) - (60% of your claims)

- If you have more tokens than the random address, we add 50 tokens to your reward.

- If you have more tokens than the random address, we apply the same formula and reward the random address with it as well
(60% of your claims) - (60% of random_address_claims)
