# The 0xBUTT Self-Drop faucet, a passive income and a Farthings v2.0 Token

## TUTORIAL
The one-click button on a 0xbutt.com webpage where you can use MetaMask to get the tokens is under a development.

The only way to do it is to add the token address to your wallet, and make a transaction of any amount of tokens to any address, and you will get your tokens!

### Step 1. 
Go to :

### Step 2: 
Click on "Connect to Web3" and accept the popup message.

### Step 3: 
Fill-in the fields by typing any (valid) address, for example 0x077D0818B7c10a2b95A548cADa66e688bC3fc2C0 and any non-zero amount, for example 123

### Step 4: 
Sumbit

### Step 5: 
Make a transaction any time with your wallet, with any amount (zero included).




## How does it work ?
Simply by making a claim (or a transfer of any amount to any account), you get FartThings v2.0 tokens. Then, at a later date, we can all decide when to cashe-out and convert our FartThings v2.0 to 0xBUTT v2.0 coins at a 1:1 ratio. 

## When does it end ?
We are distributing 1 million 0xBUTT tokens in this manner. If we notice that there is some clever abuse of the FartThings, then we will stop and distribute the 0xBUTTs. If not, then we might even increase the amounts to several million coins. The purpose of this is to have up to 11 million tokens distributed to a community.

## Why a separate token and how much is it worth ?
Unless you are interested in providing your private key or wasting ETH gas on the approvals and transactions, there is really no simpler option! Also, the transfer of tokens costs much less than a transfer of 0xBUTT. The FartThings are not worth anyting and they are the utility tokens. They cannot be transfered and cannot be placed on exchanges. 

## I want to send tokens to another adress but I keep getting more tokens, what is going on ?
This is because the transfer function has been altered. You CANNOT send these tokens. However, you can destroy them

## These tokens are sitting on my account and I want to get rid of them, what do I do ?
You will have to go to Etherscan, and execute the Delete function. It will burn all of your FartTings tokens!

## So how does this work and how do I get the passive income at all ?

The self-drop is meant to reward anyone who makes a claim as well as any random address with the same claim. Random address is any (previous) address that made a claim. The rewards are distributed in a following manner:

- Each time you make a claim, you are guaranteed to get 10 tokens!

- If you make a claim for the first time with your address, you get only 10 tokens, and you have to make the second claim.

- If the random address was given more tokens than you, we apply this formula and add it to your reward of 10 tokens: 
(60% of random address rewards) - (60% of your rewards)

- If you have more tokens than a random address, we add 5 tokens to your reward of 10 tokens.

- If you have more tokens than a random address, we apply the same formula and reward the random address with it.
(60% of your rewards) - (60% of random address rewards)


This is how we will get a good distribution of tokens, and it is also how you may earn the tokens even if you don't make any claims!  Nevertheless, if there aren't enough people making the claims, you will not be earning anything unless making the claims yourself.
