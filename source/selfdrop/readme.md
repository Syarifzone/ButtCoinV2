This is a quick document about the ButtCoin self-drop (faucet), as well as a passive-income.

The self-drop is meant to reward anyone who makes a claim as well as any random address with the same claim. Random address is any (previous) address that made a claim. The rewards are distributed in a following manner:

Each time you make a claim, you are guaranteed to get 100 tokens!

- If you make a claim for the first time with your address, you get only 100 tokens, and you have to make the second claim.

- If the random address was given more tokens than you, we apply this formula and add it to your reward of 100 tokens: 
(60% of random address rewards) - (60% of your rewards)

- If you have more tokens than a random address, we add 50 tokens to your reward of 100 tokens.

- If you have more tokens than a random address, we apply the same formula and reward the random address with it.
(60% of your rewards) - (60% of random address rewards)


This is how we will get a good distribution of tokens, and it is also how you may earn the tokens even if you don't make any claims!  Nevertheless, if there aren't enough people making the claims, you will not be earning anything unless making the claims yourself.
